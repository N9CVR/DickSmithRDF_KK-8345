PCB layout For Dick Smith Radio Direction Finder KK-8345 Antenna Switching Unit

This project was born when WA9TT bought most of a Dick Smith Radio Direction Finder and needed to build an antenna switching unit for it, as his didn't come with it. Schematics for the entire unit are available on the internet; the only part licensed here is the PCB layout. It is provided in hopes that it may be useful.

To make this board, download all of the Gerber and drill files (*.gbr, *.drl and *.gbrjob), zip them up, and send them to your favorite PCB manufacturer!
